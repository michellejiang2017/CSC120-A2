### What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Originally, I was confused as to just where to store my main code and how I would connect the two files to each other. I also had trouble thinking in the object-oriented framework, which led to me not formatting the functions correctly in the main code. What really helped was asking myself "what does this object need to know?" For example, the computer doesn't need to know that it's in the resale shop, but the resale shop needs to know that it has the computer. Also, since I took IB Computer Science, I had no clue about what the style guide was for Python because in IB all the variables are capitalized (since we had to write the code on paper) so using the Python style guide documentation was really helpful. 

For someone taking this course in the future I would say have the Python documentation open on a second screen for reference. I think it's also better to try and keep everything simple and be as lazy as possible (ie reuse as much of the code that's already been written as possible).
