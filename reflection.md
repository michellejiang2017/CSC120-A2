Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Originally, I was confused as to just where to store my main code and how I would connect the two files to each other. What really helped was asking myself "what does this object need to know?" For example, the computer doesn't need to know that it's in the resale shop, but the resale shop needs to know that it has the computer. 

For someone taking this course in the future I would say have the Python documentation open on a second screen for reference. I think it's also better to try and keep everything simple and be as lazy as possible (ie reuse as much of the code that's already been written as possible).
